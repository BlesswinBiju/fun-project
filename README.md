# Motta Puffs üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Tech Titans


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Blesswin Biju - Sahrdaya College Of Advanced Studies

### Project Description
Motta Puff is a website that takes a self-description from a user and uses AI to generate a humorous and personalized roast. As an added bonus, it also features a fun digital gift-unwrapping experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world full of self-love and positive affirmations, we found a critical lack of personalized, harmless insults to keep everyone grounded. People are becoming too comfortable with themselves and need a friendly reminder that nobody's perfect.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our AI, affectionately known as the 'Motta Roaster,' takes your self-aggrandizing description and turns it into a masterpiece of comedic criticism. We've also included a gift unwrapping mini-game because sometimes you need a little digital treat after being roasted.
